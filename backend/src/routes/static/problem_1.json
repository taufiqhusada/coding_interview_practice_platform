You can assume there's exactly one solution, and you cannot use the same element twice. Do you have any questions before we begin?"

    {
        "role": "interviewee",

For example, with input nums = [2, 7, 11, 15] and target = 9, the output should be [0, 1] since nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9. Is that correct?",

        "content": "Yes, I could use a hash map to store the numbers I’ve seen so far and their indices. As I iterate through the array, I can check if the difference between the target and the current number exists in the hash map. If it does, we found our pair. This would reduce the time complexity to O(n).",
